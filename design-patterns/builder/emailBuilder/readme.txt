Requirements:

to(String) - required (pass in Builder constructor)
subject(String) - required (pass in Builder constructor)
cc(String) - optional, can be called multiple times to add multiple CC recipients
bcc(String) - optional, can be called multiple times
body(String) - optional
priority(String) - optional, defaults to "normal"
attachment(String) - optional, can be called multiple times
toString() should display all set fields
