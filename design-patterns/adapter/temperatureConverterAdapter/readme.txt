Design Temperature Converter Adapter

Problem: You have a Thermometer interface that returns temperature in Celsius. 
A third-party weather sensor library provides readings in Fahrenheit through a different interface. 
Write an adapter so your application can use the Fahrenheit sensor as if it were a Celsius thermometer.

Requirements:

Target interface: Thermometer with getTemperature() returning Celsius (double)
Adaptee: FahrenheitSensor with readFahrenheit() returning Fahrenheit (double)
Adapter: converts Fahrenheit to Celsius using (F - 32) * 5/9
