Exercise 1: Simplify a StringFormatter

Simplify StringFormatter

Problem: A developer built an overengineered string formatting system. There is a FormatterRegistry that stores formatters,
 a FormatterFactory that creates them, and a FormatterChain that applies them in sequence. 
 All of this just to format a user's display name (trim whitespace and capitalize the first letter).

Your task: replace the entire system with a single formatDisplayName method.

Requirements:

Accept a raw name string (e.g., " john doe ")
Trim leading and trailing whitespace
Capitalize the first letter of the result
Return the formatted string (e.g., "John doe")
